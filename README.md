Memory Game is a classic memory matching game built with React, Sass, and Vite. The game provides a fun and interactive way to test and improve your memory skills. This project allows users to select different themes, the number of players, grid sizes, and tile shapes.

## Usage

1. **Start the Game:**

   - Select your desired theme (Numbers or Icons).
   - Choose the number of players (1 to 4).
   - Select the grid size (4x4 or 6x6).
   - Pick the tile shape (Circle or Squircle).
   - Click on "Start Game" to begin.

2. **Gameplay:**

   - Click on tiles to reveal the hidden numbers or icons.
   - Match pairs of identical tiles to remove them from the board.
   - The game tracks the time taken and the number of moves made.

3. **Restart or Start a New Game:**
   - Click "Restart" to restart the current game.
   - Click "New Game" to go back to the setup screen and select new preferences.

## Game Rules

- The goal is to match all pairs of tiles with the same number or icon.
- The game ends when all pairs have been matched.
- Try to complete the game in the least amount of time and moves possible.

## What I learned

By using just one property `aspect-ratio`, we can keep the shape of the box as square when scaling down the screen.

```css
.container {
  width: 100%;
  aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;
}
```

Note that for this to work for Safari, the `width` property is also needed.
